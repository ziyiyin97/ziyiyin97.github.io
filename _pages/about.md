### About me

I am a 2nd year PhD student in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu) (with a minor in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu)) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu), advised by [Prof. Felix J. Herrmann](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/felix-herrmann). I work in SLIM ([Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modeling](https://slim.gatech.edu)) group on wave-equation based imaging and inversion, such as seismic imaging and photoacoustic imaging, where we estimate acoustic parameters for Earth substructure exploration and for anomaly detection in human skull.

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I graduated from [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) in 2019, with B.S. (summa cum laude) in Mathematics and Computer Science. I conducted research on regularization methods for X-ray tomography imaging advised by [Prof. James G. Nagy](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~nagy/) and wrote my honors thesis on [Edge Detection and Enriched Subspaces](https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/7w62f916x?locale=en).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing golf, basketball and hiking.

## About me

I am a research geophysicist in [Oxy](https://www.oxy.com/)'s subsurface innovation lab, mainly working on generative AI solutions for seismic imaging and inversion.

I earned my PhD degree in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu) in 2024, advised by [Prof. Felix J. Herrmann](https://cse.gatech.edu/people/felix-herrmann). I earned my BSc degree in [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.math.emory.edu) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) in 2019, advised by [Prof. James G. Nagy](http://www.math.emory.edu/~nagy/).

A super high-level summary of my research is ***high-dimensional Bayesian inference for computationally expensive parameter-to-observable maps***. Generally, my research interests include:

* scientific machine learning
* large-scale inverse problems
* high-performance computing
* computational imaging
* numerical modeling and simulation
* uncertainty quantification
* simulation-based inference
* and their application in geophysical inversion

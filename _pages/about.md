## About me

I am currently a Founding Member of Technical Staff at [KronosAI](https://kronosai.co/), focusing on building foundation models for physics simulations.

A super high-level summary of my research scope is ***high-dimensional Bayesian inference for computationally expensive parameter-to-observable maps***. Generally, my research interests include:

* scientific machine learning
* large-scale inverse problems
* high-performance computing
* computational imaging
* numerical modeling and simulation
* uncertainty quantification
* simulation-based inference

Please feel free to visit my [Curriculum Vitae](https://ziyiyin97.github.io/files/Ziyi_Yin_CV.pdf) to know more about my industrial experiences and academic backgrounds.

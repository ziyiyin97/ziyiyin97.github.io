### About me

I am a 3rd year PhD student in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu), advised by [Prof. Felix J. Herrmann](https://cse.gatech.edu/people/felix-herrmann). I work in SLIM ([Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modeling](https://slim.gatech.edu)) group on multiphysics-driven machine learning, especially in the field of time-lapse seismic monitoring of carbon capture and storage (CCS). We aim to develop low-cost & robust seismic imaging methods and build open-source software framework to

* monitor the CO2 movement in the Earth subsurface
* mitigate the risk of CO2 leakage by early detection
* evaluate sensitivity of seismic monitoring for CCS

In general, my research interests include (but not limited to)

* machine learning
* large-scale inverse problems
* scientific computing
* PDE-constrained optimization
* computational imaging
* uncertainty quantification

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I graduated from [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) in 2019, with a *summa cum laude* Bachelor of Science degree in [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.math.emory.edu). I conducted research on regularization methods for image reconstruction from CT scans, advised by [Prof. James G. Nagy](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~nagy/) and wrote my honors thesis, [Edge Detection and Enriched Subspaces](https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/7w62f916x?locale=en).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing golf, basketball and hiking.
